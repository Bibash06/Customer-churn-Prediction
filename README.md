# Customer Churn Prediction

## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning techniques. Customer churn is a critical metric for businesses, and predicting which customers are likely to churn can help in implementing proactive retention strategies.

## Project Overview
The tasks performed in this project include:
1. **Exploratory Analysis and Feature Engineering:**
   - Explored the dataset and performed necessary data preprocessing.
   - Handled categorical features and encoded them for modeling.

2. **Train/Test Split:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Addressed class imbalance using the stratify option.

3. **Predictive Model Building:**
   - Implemented machine learning classifiers to predict customer churn.
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.

4. **Model Evaluation and Selection:**
   - Compared the performance of different classifiers.
   - Choose XGBoost as the model for deployment due to its high accuracy and F1-score.

## Deployment Considerations
After deploying the model into production, monitor its performance over time:
- **Data Drift:** Watch for changes in the input data distribution and update the model accordingly.
- **Concept Drift:** Be aware of changes in the relationship between inputs and outputs; retrain the model if necessary.

## Future Work
Enhance the project by:
- Implementing continuous monitoring and automated retraining.
- Developing a user interface for easy interaction.
- Exploring more advanced feature engineering techniques.
